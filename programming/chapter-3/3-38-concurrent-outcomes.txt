a. You could end up with ending balances of:
35, 40, 45, 50

b. You could end up with:
50, 80, or 110 (if all 3 balances are read concurrently but only one commits)
40, 55, or 60 (if the first two happen concurrent, and the last is before or after)
And some other options if the other two combinations of two concurrent events and one nonconcurrent event happen, with the nonconcurrent being either before or after
