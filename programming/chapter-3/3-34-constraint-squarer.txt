This will probably work when setting input, but not output.

- If the multiplier gets two input values set at once, and will correctly propogate to the output.
- If both input and output are set, we'll correctly say there's a violation.
- However, if we get just an output value, we won't know to propogate that backwards to the input. Because:
  - Our multiplier is only designed to return a 3rd output when the first 2 are set
  - Our multiplier knows nothing about how to take a square root :)
