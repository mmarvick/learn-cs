The pattern of ordering is like this:

1  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20
   3  5  9 13 17 21
      7 11 19
        15

(1,1) has nothing before it
(1,2) has 1 thing before it
(1,3) has 3 things before it
(1,4) has 5 things before it
...
(1,11) has 19 things before it

In general, (1, N) has (- (* 2 (- N 1)) 1) things before it
                   or: (- (* N 2) 3)
   except, (1,1) has 0

In general, (2, N) has (1, N)'s number before plus (- (*2 N) 5)
   except, (2,2 has just 1 added)

A pattern seems to be emerging for (3, N) that's similar, except for (3,3)

In general, it seems all (N,N) have (- (expt 2 N) 2) things beore them no matter what, then we can use the row-based additions to figure out the rest

For all other values, I think we could build up something recursive using the patterns we've found, but I'm going to stop here :)

I think we could build some sort or recursive statement off of this and generalizing, but I'm going to stop here

I'm not sure how to calculate beyond that and don't want to generalize, but I think a pattern could be drawn :)
