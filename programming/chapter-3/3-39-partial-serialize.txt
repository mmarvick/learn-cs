The following would remain:

- 100 (we read values and calculate 10^2, then the atomic increment completes, then we save the result of the square while disregarding the increment)
- 101 (both parts of the squaring complete, and then the atomic increment completes)
- 121 (the atomic increment completes, and then the both parts of the squaring complete)
