Using the lower id for deadlock avoidance is more trivial when you have just two objects you want to serialize on and avoid ordering between.

If you have more advanced transactions, this is trickier. What if each account can have a list of related accounts, and you want to "average" the account balances for all accounts related to a given account. If you were averaging multiple accounts, but none of the accounts can go below 0 so you can't just shuffle in order of account id in one pass, then you might have to make shuffles either multiple times or not exclusively in order of id.
