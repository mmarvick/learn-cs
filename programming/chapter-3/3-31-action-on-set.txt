If we didn't call the procedure right away, then the initial state could be invalid (since the outputs may not be correct for the given inputs).

In the example given, it'd make no difference since both input and output wires init to 0. This output state is correct for the input state. If it wasn't, however, we'd see the result for the carry and/or sum update after the appropriate delay.
