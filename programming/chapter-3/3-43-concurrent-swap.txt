The problem is something like this:

Account A - $10
Account B - $20
Account C - $30

Start swap of B and C
  calculate that $10 should go from C to B
Start swap of A and C
  calculate that $20 should go from C to A
Debit C by $10 (note - same outcome even if debit and credits aren't interleaved)
Debit C by $20
Credit B by $10
Credit A by $20

New state:

Account A - $30
Account B - $30
Account C - $0

You don't end up with any _lost_ money, as you're always doing a debit and credit of the same amount and each account's updates are serialized such that two updates don't overwrite eachother.

However, you don't end up with the intended effect of having accounts at $10, $20, and $30.
