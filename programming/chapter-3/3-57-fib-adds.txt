Number of adds: n-2 (assuming n is 1-based)

If we didn't delay, it'd be exponentially higher because we'd be following the substitution model.

Example:

(cons-stream 0
             (cons-stream 1
                          (add-streams (stream-cdr fibs)
                                       (fibs))))

Would become

(cons-stream 0
            (cons-stream 1
                        (add-streams (cons-stream 1
                                                  (add-streams (stream-cdr fibs)
                                                                fibs))
                                     (cons-stream 0
                                                  (cons-stream 1
                                                              (add-streams (stream-cdr fibs)
                                                                            fibs))))))

Which would continue to expand...
