These appear to be the same - I had to draw out the second algo to proove to myself how it worked.

These both are in-order traversal (go all the way to the left, then back up, then right)

The former algo has O(n^2) complexity (since append is O(n))
    THIS WAS WRONG! It's actually O(n log(n))
    This is unintuitive to me, even after looking at the solutions. I'll have to think about this a bit more. I believe it's weighted on the fact that append is only done on the nodes, and based on the fact that the left branch is often null or short.
The latter has O(n) complexity (since I always have myself being cons-ed with the right side)
